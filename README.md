### What's up. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in Python, Automation, Big Data and Cloud Services. 
Interested in all things Software Engineering. 

I'm a newly grad engineer from SJSU with a BS in Computer Engineering, looking to further my education in the masters program.


Previously interned at Symantec in Mountain View, working on AWS Automation infrastructure for data analytics for Symantec VIP's service alerters. 
I was a core member on the intern team, and heavily contributed to the backend framework of the project.

I'm currently open for internship or full time opportunities, feel free to reach out!
Let's solve problems, together.
