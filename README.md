### What's up. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in Python, Automation, Software Systems, and Cloud Services. Interested in all things Software Engineering.

Previously interned at Symantec in Mountain View, working on an internal tool for Symantec VIP. The tool automated workflow tasks for on-call Site Reliability Engineers by using several AWS services. I was a core member on the intern team, and heavily contributed to the design, development, and maintenance of the tool.
